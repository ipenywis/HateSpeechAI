3261,2,@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked.
3262,2,The goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff.
3263,2,"I'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen, so it could be an interesting incident notification tool."
3264,2,"however, it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at, won't work."
3265,2,"it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?"

3333,2,"Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past."
3334,2,verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
3335,2,"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
3336,2,the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.
3337,2,"add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch)."
3338,2,does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.
3339,2,"phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse."
3340,2,"in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect."
3341,2,"don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA"" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3"
3342,2,@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.
3343,2,@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
3344,2,"@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :P"
3345,2,@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?
3346,2,@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
3347,2,@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
3348,2,@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #.
3349,2,it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
3350,2,pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE
3351,2,go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.
3352,2,*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way.

3355,2,@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
3356,2,@eDRoaCH @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique...
3357,2,@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.
3358,2,"@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad."
3359,2,i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.
3360,2,"@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose."

3374,2,"@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort, though. most trolls just pick a new target."
3375,2,"@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment."
3376,2,@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.
3377,2,@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.
3378,2,@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.

3380,2,@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.
3381,2,@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have
3382,2,@limbclock i wouldn't do that.

7710,2,"You aren't just one person. There are many of us, and we all have voices. But more than that, we have resources, experience, and passion."
7711,2,You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this.
